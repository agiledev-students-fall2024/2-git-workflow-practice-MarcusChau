## Article I Found Interesting

I recently read [this article on software engineering best practices](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/how-to-do-scrum-with-jira). I recently read this article on how to do Scrum with Jira. It dives into essential techniques like code reviews and writing test cases, which are crucial for maintaining high-quality code. I particularly found the discussion on refactoring to be eye-opening, as it emphasized the importance of keeping codebases clean and maintainable over time.

Comment by FinnickL: This is a nice article and teaches me how to do better at software engineering.
